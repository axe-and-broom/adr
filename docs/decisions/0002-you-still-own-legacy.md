# 0002 - You still own legacy

No matter if you wrote the code or inherited it, and regardless of how old it is, you still own it. Ignoring legacy code is not an option.

## Context and Problem Statement

Developers and product owners often ignore legacy code, considering it as something that is not worth the effort. This is a general bad habit that should be avoided at all costs. No matter if you classify the code as legacy, if it runs in production it must be maintained until it's no longer needed and removed from the project entirely.

Many developers try to brush legacy off saying that they are working on a 2.0 version of the code that they will launch in the next quarter. As we all know about time estimation we are often wrong, and the 2.0 version gets delayed or is not fully featured compared to the legacy code it's trying to replace. Defending the decision to ignore legacy code is basically saying that you will spend zero effort on the code that is running in production every day and bringing value to the company.

## Considered Options

* Ignoring legacy code
* Recognizing legacy code is still code that is running every day in production

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Recognizing legacy code is still code that is running every day in production", you own the code so act like it! No matter if you wrote it or inherited it, you are responsible for it. Ignoring it is not an option. If you see something that can be improved, do it.
